Keyboard HID implementation for the Raspberry Pico / RP2040, based on the TinyUSB hid_composite example. Runs at 1000hz.

*** Build instructions

Follow the Pico build instructions (I could never get them to work on Windows, and had more luck on macOS), then run b.sh in the build directory. Mount the Pico as a drive by holding the button when plugging it in, then run d.sh from the same dir.
